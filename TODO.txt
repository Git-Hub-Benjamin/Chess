-fix local game not working when move highlighitng is not activated, i think this is 
because the logic in startgame is trying to use the possibleMovesVec to check valid move but it is not filled 

- implement move history (redo and undo)
- implement changing art & color during local game
- implement being able to cancel / change (from move) when choosing (to move)

- add an option for dynamic move highlighitng vs move highlighitng vs no move highlighting (each better for performance)
