TODO:

- implement move history (redo and undo)
- implement changing art & color during local game
    - started implemented the above but fucks up when in noncanonical mode bc 
      reading input for the color and art query is cannonical
- fix clearing the screen just looks dumb, it looks good but its off by a line sometimes
- fix logic in dev_mode.cpp something is not working with the king logic with the colors,
    as well as isolateonemovefromcheck, idk if we even need that

COMPLETED:

-fix local game not working when move highlighitng is not activated, i think this is 
because the logic in startgame is trying to use the possibleMovesVec to check valid move but it is not filled 
- add screen to choose who goes first / or random
- add an option for dynamic move highlighitng vs move highlighitng vs no move highlighting (each better for performance)
- implement being able to cancel / change (from move) when choosing (to move)
